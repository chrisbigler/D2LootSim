# D2LootSim - Edge of Fated Leveling & Tiers Rework
A Monte Carlo simulation system for Destiny 2's **Edge of Fated Leveling & Tiers Rework** - modeling tier-based progression (T1-T5), Guardian Rank/Conquests unlocks, and the new activity reward structures that prioritize time respect and generous loot distribution.
